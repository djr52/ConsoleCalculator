# ConsoleCalculator
Console Calculator for IS421


This Console Calculator will calculate 2 values and return the calculated result based on the selected operation. However, instead of using simple methods, classes and variables, the project instead utilizes design patterns, delegates/events, lambda functions, etc. This is to ensure the Console Calculator follows OOPs principles (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation), and the SOLID principles (such as applying Single-responsibility, Open-closed Principle, Liskov Subsitution Principle, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) as much as possible. Design patterns such as Strategy, Factories/Abstract Factories, Observers, are utilized in order to keep the Calculator abstract and easy to work with, in case of any potential future extensions. This article will go over the Console Calculator's major functionalities, and how SOLID and the design patterns were applied.
